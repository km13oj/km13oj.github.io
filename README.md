# km13oj Portfolio Site

## Welcome to my standin portfolio website. This repo is where I built my first portfolio site. 
## If you have any questions or comments about my code, please reach out at kmeyerto@gmail.com.

# Prerequisites

## You wouldn't happen to have Lombok, the font, installed on your computer, would you? I love that font, and can't get a good export to web font. If you don't have Lombok, you will have to contend with Gill. My apologies. 

# Built With

## HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript forthcoming. The weird little squares are all CSS. I believe in SCSS and tokens for component library efficiency, and am implementing more CSS tokens for this site soon.
